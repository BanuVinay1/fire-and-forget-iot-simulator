📌 Fire-and-Forget IoT Simulator:
Simulate IoT Device Data Streaming to Azure IoT Hub
This Python-based simulator mimics an IoT device by generating real-time sensor data (temperature, humidity) and publishing it to Azure IoT Hub using MQTT.

🔹 No physical IoT device needed – Just run and stream data!
🔹 Ideal for testing IoT pipelines, load testing, and real-time analytics.

Features:
Fire-and-Forget Streaming – No retry logic, just send and move on!
Sends Real Sensor Data – Randomized temperature & humidity values.
Uses MQTT Protocol – Communicates with Azure IoT Hub securely.
Can be Extended – Easily modify for multiple devices, AI, or edge computing.


Installation:
Clone the Repository

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/fire-and-forget-iot-simulator.git
cd fire-and-forget-iot-simulator

Create a Virtual Environment:
python -m venv iot_env
iot_env\Scripts\activate 

Install Dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

Configuration:
Before running the simulator, update your Azure IoT Hub details in the script:

IoT Hub Hostname → "iot-hub-<yourname>.azure-devices.net"
Device ID → "your-device-id"
SAS Token → "Your pre-generated SAS token" (Update the generate_sas.py with device details and run the script to get SAS token)

Run the script to start streaming real-time IoT data to Azure:
python Simulator.py
You'll see live messages being published to Azure IoT Hub.

Monitor Messages in Azure:
To verify data is reaching Azure IoT Hub, use:
az iot hub monitor-events --hub-name <your-iot-hub-name>

OR you can monitor using Overview in your iot hub

Future Enhancements:
Multi-Device Support
